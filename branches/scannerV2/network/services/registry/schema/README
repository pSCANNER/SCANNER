Test data for vocabulary tables is in sample_codeset_data.sql. It's a set of insert statements instead of a data file
because that's easier for Mike's tests to load. This one was generated from an extended OMOP vocabulary database with:

psql -f populate_codeset_tables.sql
pg_dump -O -a -t '*_code_set' --column-inserts > sample_codeset_data.sql

NOTE: The result sample_codeset_data.sql has been "trimmed" to remove the individual insert statements and instead just do a bulk
insert with a large set of VALUES.  This shrinks the file size by more then 50% and makes it a little easier to work with.
