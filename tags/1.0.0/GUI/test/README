The scanner_form.html and scanner_xid_form.html can be used to fake requests to the portal for authz tests; this allows
you to try options that don't show up in the browser menus. To use them:

1. Log in to the SCANNER portal as the user you want to run the tests as. Click the T&C checkbox and run a query to
initialize your session.
2. In the same browser, open the scanner_form.html file (if you want to try running a query) or scanner_xid_form.html (if you
want to try to retrieve someone's previous query results). Fill in whatever values you want and hit the submit button.
3. This should get you some query results or an error message. If you get an error message, verify that it's actually an authz
error by going back to the form and entering some parameters that you expect to work.

See https://confluence.misd.isi.edu:8443/display/SCANNER/Authz+Test+Cases for a list of test cases.

This should eventually be replaced by a more automated test system.
